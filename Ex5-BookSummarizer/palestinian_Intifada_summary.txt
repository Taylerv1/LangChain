The First Palestinian Intifada, beginning in December 1987, was a pivotal uprising against Israeli military occupation, originating in the Gaza Strip and spreading across the occupied territories. Characterized by civil disobedience such as strikes, boycotts, and underground education, it emphasized nonviolent resistance and community organization. The intifada drew international attention to the power imbalance between Israel and Palestinians, reshaping global perceptions and Palestinian national identity. It set the stage for the Madrid Conference and Oslo Accords, highlighting the unsustainability of occupation without addressing Palestinian aspirations for self-determination.
