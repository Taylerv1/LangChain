The First Palestinian Intifada, which erupted in December 1987, marked a watershed moment in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What began as spontaneous demonstrations in the Gaza Strip's Jabalia refugee camp quickly spread throughout the occupied territories, evolving into a sustained uprising against Israeli military occupation. The Arabic word "intifada," meaning "shaking off," aptly described the Palestinian people's collective attempt to challenge their circumstances through various forms of civil disobedience, including general strikes, boycotts of Israeli products, tax refusals, and the establishment of underground schools when regular institutions were closed by military order. Though often remembered for images of stone-throwing youth confronting heavily armed soldiers, the uprising was fundamentally characterized by widespread community organization and nonviolent resistance. Local committees formed to coordinate services, distribute food, and provide medical care when traditional systems broke down under curfews and closures. The intifada captured international attention and sympathy, dramatically altering global perceptions of the conflict by highlighting the power imbalance between an occupying military force and a civilian population seeking self-determination. This grassroots uprising continued until the early 1990s, eventually creating the political conditions that led to the Madrid Conference and subsequent Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian Authority and began a new, if deeply flawed, chapter in Palestinian-Israeli relations. Historians now recognize the First Intifada as a transformative period that reshaped Palestinian national identity and strategy, elevating civil resistance as a crucial component of their struggle while demonstrating the unsustainability of continued occupation without addressing Palestinian national aspirations.
